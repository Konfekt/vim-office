          vim-office, binary file viewer      *Office* *office* *vim-office*

===========================================================================

This plug-in enables Vim to read text documents of type PDF, Microsoft Office
such as Word (doc(x)), Excel (xls(x)) or Powerpoint (ppt(x)), LibreOffice
(odt), EPUB .... To go even further, for example, among many others file
formats, read media files in Vim, see the Wiki of lesspipe.sh!

It uses, whenever available, appropriate external converters such as pdftotext,
odt2txt, docx2txt.pl, pandoc, pptx2md, ... to do so, but falls back to:

- Either LibreOffice which is an office suite that can handle all those formats
  listed above, except PDFs. (To use it on Microsoft Windows, ensure after its
  installation that its path is added to the %PATH% environment variable,
  say by Rapidee.)

- Or Tika which is a content extractor that can handle all those formats listed
  above and many more. To use it:

  1. Download the latest runnable tika-app-...jar from
     https://tika.apache.org/download.html to ~/bin/tika.jar (on Linux)
     respectively %USERPROFILE%\bin (on Microsoft Windows).

  2. Create

      - on Linux, a shell script ~/bin/tika that reads

          #!/bin/sh
          exec java -jar "$HOME/bin/tika.jar" "$@" 2>/dev/null

      and mark it executable (by chmod a+x ~/bin/tika).

      - on Microsoft Windows, a batch script %USERPROFILE%\bin\tika.bat that
        reads

          @echo off
          java -jar "%USERPROFILE%\bin\tika.jar" %*


  3. Add the folder of the newly created tika executable to your environment
     variable $PATH (on Linux) respectively %PATH% (on Microsoft Windows):

      - on Linux, if you use bash or zsh by adding to ~/.profile or ~/.zshenv
        the line

          PATH=$PATH:~/bin


      - on Microsoft Windows, a convenient program to update %PATH% is
        Rapidee.
