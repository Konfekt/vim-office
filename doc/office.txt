          vim-office, binary file viewer      *Office* *office* *vim-office*

===========================================================================

This plug-in enables Vim to read text documents of type PDF, Microsoft Office
such as Word (doc(x)), Excel (xls(x)) or Powerpoint (ppt(x)), LibreOffice
(odt), EPUB .... To go even further, for example, among many others file
formats, to read media files in Vim, add the Vimscript snippet from the Wiki
https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe/wiki/vim of lesspipe.sh to your vimrc!

For the text extraction, it depends on external tools, but most use cases are
covered by an installation of

- LibreOffice and a common text browser (such as `lynx`), and
- pdftotext.

It uses, whenever available, appropriate external converters such as pandoc,
odt2txt, docx2txt.pl, xlscat, xlsx2csv, pptx2md, ..., but will fall back to:

- Either LibreOffice which is an office suite that (together with a common text
  browser such as lynx) can handle all those formats listed above, except PDFs.
  (To use it on Microsoft Windows, ensure after its installation that its path
  is added to the %PATH% environment variable, say by Rapidee.)

- Or Tika which is a content extractor that can handle all those formats listed
  above and many more. To use it:

  1. Download the latest runnable tika-app-...jar from
     https://tika.apache.org/download.html to ~/bin/tika.jar (on Linux)
     respectively %USERPROFILE%\bin (on Microsoft Windows).

  2. Create

      - on Linux, a shell script ~/bin/tika that reads

          #!/bin/sh
          exec java -jar "$HOME/bin/tika.jar" "$@" 2>/dev/null

      and mark it executable (by chmod a+x ~/bin/tika).

      - on Microsoft Windows, a batch script %USERPROFILE%\bin\tika.bat that
        reads

          @echo off
          java -jar "%USERPROFILE%\bin\tika.jar" %*


  3. Add the folder of the newly created tika executable to your environment
     variable $PATH (on Linux) respectively %PATH% (on Microsoft Windows):

      - on Linux, if you use bash or zsh by adding to ~/.profile or ~/.zshenv
        the line

          PATH=$PATH:~/bin


      - on Microsoft Windows, a convenient program to update %PATH% is
        Rapidee.
